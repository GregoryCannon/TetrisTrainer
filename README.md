# Tetris Trainer

An NES Tetris clone ([try it in your browser!](https://gregorycannon.github.io/TetrisTrainer)) that lets users play either under standard conditions, or with one of many modifications, to allow for effective practice.
 
Features:

- Frame perfect recreation of DAS, rotation, scoring, levels, etc.
- Draw or paste in a custom board and try playing out that situation
- Try out killscreen play at 50% or 33% speed (with adjusted DAS speed to mimic a realistic tap range!)
- Use Dig Practice and Drought Practice mode to practice tough sequences
- Enter a custom piece sequence to experiment with openers
- Use custom DAS settings to emulate your own hypertapping speed (without worrying about losing DAS!)
- Practice 19+ play at a slow speed to improve stacking
